Formatting Strings using Escape Sequences

You can use two or more specially designated characters within a string to format a string or perform a command. These characters are called escape sequences. An escape sequence in Python starts with a backslash (\). For example, \n is an escape sequence in which the common meaning of the letter n is literally escaped and given an alternative meaning - a new line.

Displayed here are a few common escape sequences available in python. You can try these out in IDLE or the Python prompt from the windows command prompt.
